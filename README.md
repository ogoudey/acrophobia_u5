# Installation

### ViveSR
This is a eye-tracking package that I can't see to find online anywhere. Go to Import Package and find ViveSR.unitypackage.


### Skyboxes
The skyboxes are too big of files to store on Github, so get them through the Unity Store (AllSkyFree)

### Other Asset Packs
I can't figure out why the cloned -> imported prefabs don't identify their materials and meshes. So either edit all the prefabs manually, or reimport them from the Unity Asset Store as well.

### SteamV
Install SteamVR from the Asset Store. It doesn't make much sense to upload this to Github.
